          <p>
            A 401(k) is a special type of savings account that people use to
            save money for when they retire. Retirement is when people stop
            working because they are older and want to enjoy their later years
            without having to work every day.

            Why is it Called a 401(k)?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The name "401(k)" comes from a section of the U.S. tax code, which
            is a set of laws about how taxes work in the United States. So, it's
            kind of like a fancy name given by the government.

              <strong>Saving Money from Your Paycheck:</strong>
              <p>
                When someone has a job, they get a paycheck. A 401(k) lets
                people take some money out of each paycheck and put it into this
                special savings account. This money is saved before the
                government takes out taxes, which means people save on taxes now
                and pay them later when they retire and use the money.

              <strong>Employer Matching:</strong>
              <p>
                Some companies offer a benefit called "employer matching." This
                means the company will also add money to the 401(k) account,
                usually matching what the employee puts in up to a certain
                amount. For example, if someone puts in $100, the company might
                also put in $100. This is like getting free money!

              <strong>Investment:</strong>
              <p>
                The money in a 401(k) doesn't just sit there. It's invested in
                things like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds (a mix of different
                investments). These investments can grow over time, making the
                savings account bigger.

            People can start using the money in their 401(k) when they turn 59
            1/2 years old. If they take out money before that age, they might

            Example to Understand Better:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Imagine you have a big piggy bank that you can't open until you're
            older. Every month, you put some of your allowance into the piggy
            bank. Your parents also add some extra money whenever you put money
            in. Over time, you invest this money in things that grow, like a
            garden that produces more vegetables each year. When you're older,
            you can open the piggy bank and have a lot more money than you
            originally put in, thanks to your savings, your parents'
            contributions, and the growth of your investments.
